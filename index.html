    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      As a Commercial Loan Analyst II at Truist, I utilize advanced analytical
      tools to review and assess complex commercial loan transactions, ensuring
      compliance with bank policies and regulatory standards. With over five
      years of experience in the financial services industry, including roles as
      a Client Associate and Loan Servicing Specialist at Wells Fargo, I have
      developed strong expertise in financial software, data analysis, and
      process optimization. I am dedicated to leveraging data-driven insights to
      improve operational efficiency, solve problems, and drive informed
      decision-making to better serve clients and streamline processes.
